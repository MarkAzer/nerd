	\section{Introduction} %Introduce project and aim 
	%Describe the context for the work and the problem you are addressing. Briely summarise what you achieved in the project
	The intention of this report is to present and demonstrate the progression, development and overall outcome of the Traffic Simulation application created. The report is structured into 11 sections each with a purpose to provide further understanding into the steps taken throughout the project as a whole. 
	\\ This first section is an introduction to the whole project and provides an understanding of what is to be expected throughout the entire report. The second section discusses the requirements needed for the project to be deemed successful and appropriate for the cause to fit what is needed. Section three looking into the different existing systems and how the system we are developing is different and any challenges brought about based upon what exists already. Section four discusses the system design including a user manual. In the fifth section of the report is discussion on the process of the actual implementation completed by the two main programmers in the team, which includes how prototypes were created and developed into the final application, as well as some discussion on any system design changes that happened. In the sixth section is a full technical evaluation of the system including the methods used to test the system. In the seventh section is a group evaluation of how the team has been organized throughout the project and then a discussion about the work load division, this section should give a clear insight into the team work throughout project. The eighth section of the report is a conclusion of the project as a whole specifically looking at the lessons learned about program development, what we learnt from about group work and lastly how we would progress in the future with the project. The tenth section is simply the bibliography references to sources we used throughout the report and lastly the eleventh section is the appendices of all additional relevant documents such as a group meetings, personal logs, project plans and documents that supported the system design of the application.\\
	Overall, this introduction should outline what is to be expected throughout the entire and give insight into how the group worked together to successfully create a traffic simulation.
	
	\subsection{Scope}%Need help here.
	
	\subsection{Objectives} %Making The Map - More maps addtional stuff
	The aim of the project is to build an application which will simulate cars movement on the UK road system, the users aim is able to find the perfect balance of (word here). If a road system is created using the application where the traffic light system is illogical, for example the wrong traffic light position or wrong traffic light interval this will result in a crash or unfair waiting time.
	%More needs to be added
	The value of this system isâ€¦
	What we have achieved 
	\section{Requirements} %What is needed for the project to be succesful 
	test
	
	\section{Related Work}History: 
in the past years traffic simulation models played a very important role in the performance and facilities of the road traffic. the simulation traffic models can be used in many road development processes.
Only in the United Kingdom vehicle traffic has been in a rise to 2.1 per cent comparing to the previous year 2014, the government figures show that 310.2 billions miles for the travelled vehicles in all the road in the United Kingdom only in year 2014.  
Some initial government reports show that the increased traffic raised in a four areas like services, manufacturing, production and construction. only in year 2014, there was a growth compared to the previous year 2013.

	\section{System Design}
	\subsection{User Manual}
	\section{Implementation} %Above sections can be completed for now when it gets to implementation contribution from programmers will be needed
	\subsection{System Design Changes}
	An important aspect of the traffic simulator is how it appears to the user, the graphical user interface (GUI) and as a requirement users of the application should be able to interact with it. When designing when discussing how the application should be presented to the user.
	
	A number of user interface initial designs were developed and discussed as a group taking into consideration principles and guidelines for good user interface design as noted by Donald \cite{Norman} (2002) aspects such as consistency, visibility and mapping, all important for the usability of a system. The appearance of the application is important however the usability and ease of use of the system is as just as important.

	\label{initialGUI}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{Final GUI Structure}
	\label{finalGUI}
	\end{figure}
	Figure~\ref{initialGUI} illustrates the first prototype design of the system and Figure~\ref{finalGUI} illustrates how from the prototype the system design changed to utilize space for efficiently and usability better. 
	Initially we thought we may not need a lot of space for control panel but through discussion and prototype developments we changed the control panel from being at the bottom of the screen to the left.

	\subsection{Lessons Learned} 
	\textbf{Program Development Lessons Learned:}\\ %Dicussion on the implementation
	
	\textbf{Group Work Lessons Learned:}\\ %What we learnt about group work and working together
	During the project as a group we learnt that...%for example despite each member have a defined role, there needs to be a lot of communication between all members to ensure that.
